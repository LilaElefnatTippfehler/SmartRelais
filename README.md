# SmartRelais

Small project using the ESP8266, a relais and AdafruitIO to controll a lamp.

OLD VERSION WICH WONT BE FURTHER DEVELOPED! I just kept it in a seperate branch if I'll need it again.

OTA Updates are implemented. IP_Adress/firmware or http://esp8266-SmartRelais.local/firmware

Can also be controlled with a browser.

All the fun happens on: http://esp8266-SmartRelais.local/    or IP_Adress/
